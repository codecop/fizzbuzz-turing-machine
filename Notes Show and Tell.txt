Topic: Turing Machine
---------------------

Intro and Inc 0 -> 1 (20')

What's a TM?
* a thought experiment
* infinite tape
* intruction tape?
* move according to what's on the tape
* it's a state machine

Show
* small TM to set all bits to 1.

Idea: use approvals for test as there is a toString
Idea: do not need the Symbol marker interface.
Idea: Could use char instead as well.

-

FizzBuzz needs?

* numbers?
  7 bit

* inc(number)
  0001001101
         <-1
          10

* Show raw Inc on bits

Idea: Have the position of the bit as every second slot 
  instead of marker at end of number.
  instead of 0101011$
  have       0a1b0c1d0e1f1g ... where g = bit 0, a = bit 7

Define Input: Max number of what I want.

Question: What is the end state when I do not have a display?

Infrastructure (20')

* Show test "Pih" 
* Show code for "Pih"
* Show final code for loop 1 to 16

Comments

I reinvented parts assembly. This is what I know. Am I biased?

I implementing binary operations in TM, 
  so I implemented a machine to implement Fizz Buzz

Idea: I could create it with 100 symbols that just write 1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz, but
  there is no challenge and boring.

I never appreciated how high level assembly could be.

Idea: Algorithm to write numbers and go every third and do something to field
  Do the same with 5 and then we have it
  So I do not have to deal with division.

Checkout
* Emily: cool, thank you
* Johan: very interesting, you build a machine on top of a machine to do Fizz Buzz
* Samuel: way too curious, I got bitten ;-), the file is already open in my editor
* Peter: got an idea how to present, good to hear about options
